<h2> <span class = "ti1"> What is this place?</span></h2>

<p>
Nothing much, not yet at least. This is just ground zero for a<br> 
series of future projects set in the fictional country of Yohuala.<br>
A place more real than one might initially think.<br>

<h3> Important places in Yohuala </h3>
<p>
<span class = "ln1"> <em>Remnants of Lake Atoccan:</em></span>
</p>
<img id="land1" src="rlioy.png">

<div class = boxes>
<p>
This is the remnants of lake Atoccan near the capital of Yohuala.<br>
The lake has been drained greatly since the Spanish conquest. Now all<br>
that remains are a series of swamps, rivers, and small lakes dotted around the land<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<In1> <em>Port Veratumba:</em> </In1>
</p>
<img id="land2" src="rlvt1.png">

<div class = boxes>
<p>
This is one of the most important ports in all of Yohuala. The majority of<br>
the country's imports enter through this one little piece of land. Everything,<br>
goods, services, ships, people, armies, nations, flags..... Everything comes here<br>

</p>
</div>

<p>
<In1> <em>Mountains of Mistipac:</em> </In1>
</p>

    <p>
        This image looks over the largest valley in the state known as Mistipac<br>
        It's currently the dry season, so the dense fog that blankets the land is<br>
        less common now. This state is tied with Chiatepez for having the largest
        indigenous population in the country. These include the Yacatecos and Apoctecos.
